Pinyin Mandarin Test: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/411769747/fullscreen/

My project is a game for mandarin learners like me. First click the green flag and then follow the instrutcions. As not everybody may know fruits 
names in mandarin chinese, here are the expected answers (all written in pinyin transliteration system):
banana: xiangjiao
strawberry: caomei
grape: putao
pineapple: boluo
apple: pingguo
Typing the name correctly will give the user a message. When it's typed incorrectly, the game will keep on asking you again until the user write the 
fruit name correctly! Then click on the next fruit! Tone marks must not be included.
To check the loop block please try writing one of the fruits' name incorrectly! ;)

I had this idea and mostly used scratch features as text to speech extension.
